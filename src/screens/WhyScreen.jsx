                <p className = 'lead fs-4'>Simple. Most recipe sites are <strong>full</strong> of nonsense.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style = {{fontSize:"105%"}}>"As a child, my grandfather would go into the salt mines, clutching his tiny pail in his childish fist..." <strong style = {{fontSize:"110%"}}>No!</strong></p>
                <br/><br/>
                <p style = {{fontSize:"105%", marginTop:'-3rem'}}>"I make this recipe for my darling Everleighly and my little stinker Tuckergrayson (the 'gray' is silent!). Before I share the recipe, here's why vaccines make you gay..." <strong style = {{fontSize:"130%"}}>NO!</strong></p>
                <p style = {{fontSize:"105%"}}>
                    Don't even get me started on the darn pop-ups. Or the thousands upon thousands of autoplaying video ads that auto scroll to random places on the page whenever one of them loads, or the ten million trackers, or the multi-megabyte bandwidth load...

                    You want to know what's on this site? <strong>Recipes.</strong> That's it. <br/><br/>No nonsense. No ads. No videos. No stories. Some recipes might have content notes, but the recipe is always front and center. This site is easy to use on mobile, has no pop-ups, and won't make you go over your data limit on your phone plan.

                    If this website saved you some time, some mobile data (it did), and some sanity (unquestionable), please consider donating.

                <p style = {{fontSize:"105%"}}>
                    I don't run ads on this site and I never will, so it's solely supported by donations. A couple bucks goes a long way when you have a monthly database/domain bill. I appreciate any donations more than I can say.</p>
